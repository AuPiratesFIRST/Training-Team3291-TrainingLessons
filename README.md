# Team 3291 - Au Pirates - Training System

## Welcome to Navigator (Coder) Training!

Welcome aboard crewmate!   Prepare for an adventure on the high seas.    

Like any crew, there are different levels of experience.    This training system will try to teach you if you are a new Au Pirate or an experienced navigator.   Choose your starting level and complete the training steps to the level you feel comfortable with.  

Feel free to do your own research or ask another crewmate for help.   We encourage questions and curiosity.   Even the most experienced navigator needs help sometimes.    We all learn from each other at any experience level.

Enough with the introductions, choose your path!
